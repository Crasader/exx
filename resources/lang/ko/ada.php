				<p>Coin Introduction :</p>
				<p> Ada is the first 3-generation block-chain virtual currency built with the Haskell programming language, a block-chaining application platform that can run applications in finance, diverse applications. </p>
				<p>Bitcoin, the first-generation block chain, is a coin that only functions as money, and it is a second-generation Etherium that adds additional functions such as writing a contract. Ada made it a step further and made it possible to set the Constitution and to recognize change within the framework. In other words, Ada owners can vote on how to change the protocol, how to identify stakeholder intent, and how to reduce the possibility of fragmentation. This agreement is reached through soft forks, not hard forks. </p>
				<p>In other words, it is a block chain that implements democratic change by implementing voting results that are collected by Ada owner opinions on soft fork. </p>
				<p>Ada has implemented a proven Stake protocol called Ouroboros and is built on a very complex and secure Haskell programming language that is designed to be highly secure in hacking, even when future quantum computers are developed.</p>
