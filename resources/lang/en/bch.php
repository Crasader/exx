    		<p>Bit coin cache is a virtual currency used in a bit coin cache block chain that has been hard-forked in a bit coin block chain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hard fork means artificially segmenting the block chain, and hard fork of bit coin cache was implemented on August 1, 2017. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Users who had a bit coin received the same amount of bit coin cache, which was distributed as much as the amount of existing bit coin. </font></font><!-- /react-text --><br></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The discussion of hard fork started at a block size of bit coin that was limited to 1MB. </font></span><span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The bit coin grew rapidly in the short term, and transactions increased a lot, but the block size remained the same. </font></span><span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two solutions were devised: Segwight and increasing block size. Bitcoin networks agreed to Segwitt, but there were forces that opposed it. </p>
				<p>1. The Bit Coin Cache Block Chain adopts Bitcoin ABC technology which can flexibly extend the block size from 2 MB to 8 MB. By increasing the block size of the existing 1MB, you can increase the number of transactions in one block. Therefore, you can pay a lower fee than the existing beat coin, and you will be able to receive the contract sooner. This approach solves the bit coin scaling problem with segmented and other approaches. * Segwight is a scaling method that improves the signature part of the protocol and has the same effect as expanding to 4MB without increasing the block size. </p>
				<p>2. Unlike the bit coin, which adjusts the difficulty level for every 2016 blocks, the bit coin cache adjusts the difficulty for every 6 blocks. Unlike bit coin, it has a lot of hash power and it takes a long time to generate a block. It is under adjustment now, and it is said that it is trying to meet an average of ten minutes.</p>
