    <h3>Coin Introduction</h3>
<p>If the bit coin is gold, the light coin, which they describe as silver, is a virtual currency created on the basis of bit coins, and in fact, it is a derived currency of bit coin because it uses almost the same algorithm as bit coin from a technical point of view. However, complementing the shortcomings of bit coin and becoming a better virtual currency is called Light Coin\'s goal. For example, we have already implemented Segwitt in 2017 prior to the bit coin, and we are also developing a lightning network based on this.</p>

  <h3>Coin feature</h3>
 <p>Light coin is similar to bit coin, but there are three main differences. 
1. Unlike Bitcoin, where Segwitt is still running, Light Coin has successfully implemented it in May 2017. Segwight is a technology that improves the signature part of the protocol and has the same effect as extending to 4MB without increasing the block size. Light Coin has already been solved before scaling issues arise, which can only be raised structurally if volume increases. In addition, the rapid implementation of Segwic is positive in that it can facilitate the development of new technologies. 2. Reduce the coin generation cycle to 1/4 to speed up transactions and increase call volume by 4 times. 3. The cryptographic hash function also uses a different one. The bit coin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which can be applied to the mining equipment called ASIC, which increases the difficulty and increases the entry barriers to mining. Light Coin uses an algorithm called Scrypt-Resistant Script (Scrypt) to prevent this mining power from concentrating. At first, it seemed to be possible to realize the original intent of mining people, but since the introduction of script-specific ASIC equipment, it did not achieve its original purpose.</p>
