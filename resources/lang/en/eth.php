    <h3>Coin Introduction</h3>
 <p>Etherium is a platform that supports a variety of app development based on block chains, and the virtual money used here is also known by the same name. 
1. Platform: Etherium is a platform for programming everything using block chains. Provides scalability to transparently run decentralization apps (DAPP) as well as transaction history. Platforms are based on smart contracts designed to accurately execute programmed contracts. 2. Money: The virtual currency used on the Etherium platform is needed by developers who make DAPP and users who want to use smart contracts. The current virtual currency market cap is in a unique position, following the beat coin. It is considered to be one of the most revolutionary technologies in the digital field, and it has actually won the competition\'s top spot in the competition.The Mark of the World \'(IT W / S). </p>


<h3>Coin feature</h3>
1. <p>Etherium can run a variety of applications, which can be extended to finance, shared economy, SNS, and decentralized organization (DAO). (GNO) and Auger (AUG), which provide a decentralized forecast market; WeiFund, a decentralized crowdfunding platform; and Airlock, an access protocol for the Internet and smart assets.</p> 
2. <p>Unlike the limited instruction of bit coin, it supports smart contract coding through Turing complete language such as Serpent of similar structure of Python, solidity similar to C ++, and LLL similar to Lisp to support various level of application. Users can create contracts and DAPP using these programming languages. 3. There is no issuance limit, but the number of coins that can be issued in a year is limited to 18 million. Coin issuance is not constant, because it changes the algorithm of difficulty of difficulty in consideration of inflation. It plays a role in adjusting the block cycle, and it interacts with the basic algorithm formulation to control the issue volume flexibly. (The basic inflation formula is that 5 ea is issued per block, and some new coins are also issued to Uncle.)</p>

 <h3>Field of application</h3>
(Keyword: Smart contract, Ethernet platform scalability through DAPP) 
1.<p> Smart contract: Because it is written in executable code, which is a computer language, the program is executed automatically when certain conditions are met and the contract is fulfilled. Because the contract is enforced, you can exercise your strength in cases where you can not trust your opponent. This eliminates the possibility of system failure, fraud, or third party interference. 2. Etherium platform scalability through DAPP: For Etherium, the network platform is more meaningful than the currency itself. The technology that combines decentralized DAPP, smart contract, and Internet (IoT) will enable even inter-machine financial transactions that completely exclude human intervention in the future. Given that over 100 coins run on the Etherium platform, you can guess its scalability.</p>
