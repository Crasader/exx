    <h3>Coin Introduction</h3>
   <p>Initially called "joke currency", the doji coin, which started like a joke, uses Japanese Shibain as a mascot. This is a picture that was used for fun on the internet, and the same picture is used as a coin\'s logo. This emphasizes that Doji Koin is a fun and friendly virtual currency. Even if you only access the homepage right away, you can easily install the Togo coin purse. 
Developer Billy Marcus says he made Doji coins for the wider population without being misused, unlike bit coins used on the illegal drug trade site Silk Road.
